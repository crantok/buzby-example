# Buzby (the Bloody Small Site Builder) example site

This is a simple example site for Buzby. It features:

* One item of published content.
* One item of unpublished content.
* One home page view.
* One php contact page view.

All the files above are found in the ./src directory.

Two other things have been changed:

* A build_assets directory has been added, which contains some PHP code for inclusion in the PHP contact page.
* view.rb has been modified in order to add the above item to the PHP contact page.
